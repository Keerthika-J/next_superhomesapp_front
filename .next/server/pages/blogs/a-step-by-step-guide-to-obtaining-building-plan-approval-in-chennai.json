Step 7: Approval or Rejection</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the plans are found to be compliant, the local authority will issue an approval. In case of non-compliance, you&#39;ll receive a rejection along with the reasons for the decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. Step 8: Payment of Fees</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon approval, you&#39;ll be required to pay the stipulated fees for building plan approval.
