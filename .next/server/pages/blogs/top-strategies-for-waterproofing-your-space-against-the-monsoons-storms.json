Consider installing French drains if needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rainwater Harvesting: Embrace the monsoon by collecting rainwater for future use through rainwater harvesting systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6.

Address issues promptly to prevent structural damage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ventilation: Maintain proper ventilation to prevent condensation and mold growth, which can result from excess humidity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7.
