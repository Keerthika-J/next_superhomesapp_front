Create open spaces that allow for easy movement and avoid overcrowding. Choose furniture arrangements that promote interaction and comfort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Neutral and Earthy Tones: A Calming Palette</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neutral and earthy color tones evoke a sense of calmness and connection to nature.

Mindful Decor: Objects of Significance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Incorporate decor that holds personal significance and resonates with your values.
